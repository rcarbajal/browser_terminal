Buttons and textboxes with a touch of particle effects and sound thrown in.<br /><br /><img src='http://www.holycow2.com/images/yahtzee_screen.jpg' /><br /><a href='http://www.holycow2.com/games/yahtzee' target='_blank'>http://www.holycow2.com/games/yahtzee</a><br /><br />",
	"tilegame" : "<br />2D Tile-based Game (Language: ActionScript 3)<br />---------------------------------------------<br />I wanted to try my hand at Flash game programming and I found a <a href='http://www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/' target='_blank'>tutorial</a> that's served as my base.  It's a bit of a challenge translating a Flash 5 tutorial into AS3/Flex with only available free tools to do it, but that's also what makes it awesome! It's not much at this point, but it will continue to change as I add more features.  Arrow keys to move and left mouse click to shoot.<br /><br /><img src='http://www.holycow2.com/images/tilegame_screen.jpg' /><br /><a href='http://www.holycow2.com/games/tilegame' target='_blank'>http://www.holycow2.com/games/tilegame</a><br /><br />",
